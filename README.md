# The-False-Human-Belief

As a man was passing the elephants,he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by a small rope tried to their front led. No chains,no cages.It was obvious that the elephants could,at anytime can break away from their bonds but for some reason,they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away."well," trainer said,"when they are very young and much smaller we use the same rope to tie them and,at that age, it's enough to hold them.As they grow up,they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away.They believe the rope can still hold them,so they never try to break free".
